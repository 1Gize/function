== What is it?

Program works as function which finds middle element of array.

== Dependencies

Only out-of-the-box scala is needed

== How to run?

To run this program first run main class

== What were the main difficulties?
The main difficulty was understanding the code that was given, to understand it better i
printed myself every argument that was passed which somewhat helped. After that the main
problem was solving it and i couldnt do that. I could only make it work for even numbered array
or for not even never for both(by adding logic gates before executing loop function)
